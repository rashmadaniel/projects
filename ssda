# Ultrasonic Guiding Wristband for Blind People

A smart wearable device designed to assist visually impaired individuals in navigating obstacles using an ultrasonic sensor and buzzer feedback.

## ðŸ”§ Hardware Required
- Arduino Uno or Nano
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- Buzzer (or vibrating motor)
- Jumper wires, breadboard
- Optional: DFPlayer Mini for voice feedback

## ðŸ”Œ Circuit Connections
| Component       | Arduino Pin |
|----------------|-------------|
| HC-SR04 Trig    | D9          |
| HC-SR04 Echo    | D10         |
| Buzzer          | D6          |
| VCC/GND         | 5V/GND      |

## ðŸ§  How It Works
- The ultrasonic sensor detects distance to nearby objects.
- If an object is within 50 cm, the buzzer vibrates/beeps.
- Designed to be worn as a wristband for hands-free mobility.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
1. Wire the components as shown above.
2. Upload `ultrasonic_wristband.ino` to your Arduino board.
3. Power the board and test the wristband by placing obstacles.

## ðŸŽ¯ Future Improvements
- Add voice feedback using DFPlayer Mini.
- Integrate OCR camera to convert text to speech.
